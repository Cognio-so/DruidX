## User's Complex Query
{query}

## Task: Intelligent Research Planning

Analyze the query and break it down into targeted sub-questions. The NUMBER of sub-questions should be determined by the query's COMPLEXITY and SCOPE:

### Guidelines for Number of Sub-Questions

- **Simple/Narrow queries** (single concept, straightforward): 2-4 sub-questions
- **Moderate queries** (multiple aspects, some depth needed): 5-7 sub-questions  
- **Complex/Broad queries** (multi-faceted, interdisciplinary, extensive scope): 8-12 sub-questions
- **Highly complex queries** (systems-level, research-intensive): 10-15+ sub-questions

### Query Analysis Framework

First, assess the query for:

1. **Breadth**: How many distinct topics/domains does it cover?
2. **Depth**: How much detail/expertise is required?
3. **Temporal scope**: Does it require historical context, current state, and future outlook?
4. **Stakeholders**: How many perspectives need to be considered?
5. **Interconnections**: How many relationships between concepts need exploring?

### Sub-Question Categories (adapt based on query)

Generate sub-questions covering relevant categories:

- **Foundational**: Core definitions, concepts, and principles
- **Historical/Context**: Background, evolution, and how we got here
- **Current State**: Present situation, recent developments, latest data
- **Technical/Mechanisms**: How things work, underlying processes
- **Stakeholders/Perspectives**: Who's involved, different viewpoints
- **Challenges/Controversies**: Problems, debates, conflicting views
- **Comparisons**: Alternatives, related concepts, benchmarking
- **Impact/Implications**: Consequences, effects, significance
- **Practical Applications**: Real-world use cases, implementations
- **Future/Trends**: Emerging developments, predictions, potential directions
- **Quantitative/Data**: Metrics, statistics, measurable aspects
- **Qualitative/Experience**: User experiences, case studies, narratives

### Output Format

Provide ONLY a numbered list of sub-questions. Each should be:
- Specific and focused (not too broad)
- Answerable through research
- Relevant to addressing the original query
- Clear and unambiguous

Do NOT include explanations, just the numbered list of sub-questions.

## Your Task: Comprehensive Gap Analysis

Perform a thorough analysis to determine research completeness:

### 1. Coverage Assessment

Evaluate if the gathered information adequately covers:
- All key aspects of the original query
- Both breadth (multiple dimensions) and depth (sufficient detail)
- Different perspectives and viewpoints
- Factual accuracy and reliability
- Practical applicability

### 2. Confidence Scoring (0.0-1.0)

Assign a confidence score based on:

- **0.0-0.3**: Minimal coverage, major gaps, insufficient to answer query
- **0.3-0.5**: Partial coverage, significant gaps remain, needs more research
- **0.5-0.7**: Moderate coverage, some gaps, additional research would help
- **0.7-0.85**: Good coverage, minor gaps, mostly sufficient to answer
- **0.85-0.95**: Excellent coverage, minimal gaps, comprehensive answer possible
- **0.95-1.0**: Outstanding coverage, no significant gaps, definitive answer ready

### 3. Gap Identification

Identify specific gaps in:

- **Missing information**: What critical information wasn't found?
- **Unclear areas**: What needs clarification or deeper exploration?
- **Conflicting information**: What contradictions need resolution?
- **Insufficient depth**: What topics need more detailed investigation?
- **Missing perspectives**: What viewpoints or angles are absent?
- **Outdated information**: What areas need current/updated data?

### 4. Follow-Up Question Generation

Based on gaps identified, generate TARGETED follow-up questions:

- Number of questions should match gap severity:
  * Confidence 0.7-0.85: 1-2 specific follow-up questions
  * Confidence 0.5-0.7: 3-5 follow-up questions  
  * Confidence < 0.5: 5-8 follow-up questions

- Each question should address a SPECIFIC gap
- Questions should be distinct from already-researched questions
- Prioritize questions that will have the most impact on answering the original query
- Make questions precise and focused (not broad or vague)

### 5. Iteration Decision

Consider:
- Is another iteration justified given remaining gaps?
- Will additional research significantly improve the answer?
- Are we experiencing diminishing returns?

### Content Quality Standards

#### **Information Density**
Every paragraph must include:
- ✅ Specific facts, figures, or examples
- ✅ Evidence from at least 1-2 sources
- ✅ Analytical insight, not just description
- ❌ No filler phrases like "it's important to note"
- ❌ No vague generalities without support

**Example - LOW QUALITY:**
> "Electric vehicles are becoming more popular. They have many benefits including environmental advantages. Many companies are investing in this technology."

**Example - HIGH QUALITY:**
> "Electric vehicle adoption accelerated 55% year-over-year in 2024, with global sales reaching 14 million units [Source 3]. The environmental impact varies significantly by region: EVs in regions with renewable-heavy grids (like Norway's 98% renewable electricity) reduce lifecycle emissions by 70% compared to gasoline vehicles, while coal-dependent regions see only 25-30% reductions [Source 7, Source 12]. Major automakers have committed $515 billion to EV development through 2030, with battery costs declining from $132/kWh in 2021 to $89/kWh in 2024—approaching the critical $80/kWh threshold for price parity with internal combustion engines [Source 5, Source 9]."

#### **Source Integration**
- Cite specific sources inline: [Source 3], [Source 7, 12]
- Don't just list sources—explain what each contributes
- Cross-reference when multiple sources support a claim
- Explicitly note when sources conflict
- Use source credibility to weigh conflicting information

#### **Analytical Depth**
For each major claim:
1. **State the finding** with specifics
2. **Provide evidence** from sources
3. **Explain significance** and context
4. **Compare/contrast** with related information
5. **Discuss implications** for the query

#### **Multi-Perspective Analysis**
Address:
- Technical perspectives
- Economic implications
- Social impacts
- Environmental considerations
- Political/regulatory factors
- Industry vs. academic vs. consumer viewpoints
- Regional/cultural differences

### Writing Style Guidelines

#### **Professional Yet Accessible**
- Use clear, precise language
- Define technical terms on first use
- Vary sentence structure and length
- Create smooth transitions between sections
- Build narrative flow, not just information dumps

#### **Confident and Authoritative**
- "Research indicates..." not "Some sources say..."
- "Data demonstrates..." not "It seems like..."
- State findings directly, then support them
- Use active voice predominantly

#### **Objective and Balanced**
- Present multiple viewpoints fairly
- Acknowledge uncertainties honestly
- Don't overstate conclusions
- Distinguish facts from projections
- Note quality/reliability of sources

#### **Engaging and Readable**
- Lead with interesting findings
- Use concrete examples and case studies
- Include relevant analogies when helpful
- Break up dense text with strategic formatting
- Use rhetorical questions sparingly for transitions

### Formatting Requirements

#### **Markdown Structure**

#### **Use These Elements Strategically**
- **Bold** for emphasis on key terms or findings (sparingly)
- *Italics* for introducing new concepts
- `Code blocks` for technical terms, equations, or data
- > Blockquotes for direct source quotes (use sparingly)
- Tables for comparative data (when appropriate)
- Bullet lists for key takeaways, not regular content

### Special Handling

#### **When Sources Conflict**
```markdown
Research on [topic] presents conflicting findings. A 2024 meta-analysis [Source 3] 
suggests X, reporting [specific data], while industry reports [Source 7, 9] indicate 
Y, based on [different methodology]. This discrepancy likely stems from [explain 
differences in methodology, timeframe, or scope]. The balance of evidence, 
particularly from [more credible sources], suggests that [reasoned conclusion].
```

#### **When Information is Limited**
Be honest but thorough:
```markdown
Despite extensive research across [X] sources, comprehensive data on [specific aspect] 
remains limited. Available evidence [describe what was found]. This gap exists because 
[explain why]. Based on adjacent research on [related topics], we can reasonably 
infer [careful extrapolation with caveats].
```

#### **Integrating Multi-Level Sources**
Prioritize depth:
```markdown
Initial search results provided overview statistics [Source 1, 2], while deeper 
investigation through linked references revealed more nuanced findings. For instance, 
the frequently cited "40% improvement" figure [Source 1] derives from a controlled 
study with specific conditions [Source 5 - followed link], and real-world 
implementations show 20-35% improvements depending on [specific factors from Source 8].
```

## Executive Summary

Semaglutide, marketed as Ozempic for type 2 diabetes and Wegovy for obesity, has 
emerged as one of the most significant pharmaceutical developments of the 2020s, 
with profound implications for global healthcare systems. This analysis examines 
its multifaceted impact across economic, clinical, and systemic dimensions based 
on research spanning 47 sources across 3 research iterations.

**Key Findings:**
- Global semaglutide market projected to reach $54 billion by 2028, with obesity 
  indications driving 68% of growth [Source 3, 7]
- Clinical trials demonstrate 15.3% average weight loss over 68 weeks, significantly 
  outperforming previous interventions (7-9% for liraglutide) [Source 12, 15]
- Healthcare systems face dual impact: potential $38-57 billion in reduced obesity-related 
  costs offset by $23-31 billion in drug acquisition costs [Source 21, 23]
