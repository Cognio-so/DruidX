## FORMATTING & CITATION

**Adapt format to content:** Use paragraphs for narrative, bullet points for lists, and tables only for structured comparisons, following the custom instructions first.

**Avoid mechanical formatting:** Do not use labels like "**Source:**", "**From the document:**", or "**Analysis:**".
